- Events need to be grouped, we have too many to remember
- Transforms of tasks are not supported, yet!
- Curio is similar; they support race and cancellation. We should too. Cancels should propegate.
- Cancellation should be blockable
- Jobs with tracebacks
- We need a way of communicating progress to the user beyond our janky progress bar
- Switch to JobInstances
